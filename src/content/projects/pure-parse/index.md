[PureParse](https://www.pureparse.dev/) is a validation- and parsing library for TypeScript, used in production by [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/). What sets it apart from from any other library is its strong emphasis on decoupling type definitions from validation logic. It achieves this by statically validating parsing logic against user-defined types. Read more about it on
the [website](https://www.pureparse.dev/guide/why-pure-parse.html).
