A proof-of-concept of a 2D multiplayer game with procedural generation of destructure environments, built with

- [Rapier.js](https://rapier.rs/) for physics.
- [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) for basic rendering.
- [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla).org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) for rendering and GPU computation.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/) for triangulation for the map generation.

Give it a try on https://rockspinner-rampage.vercel.app/.

And please understand that this is a prototype made for fun :)
