We are going to taste some of the finest red wines from France and Italy from the following regions:

- Bourgogne
- Brunello di Montalcino
- Barolo
- Bordeaux

[//]: # 'TODO ITALY'

We will learn:

- What characterizes these regions
- How to select good wines from these regions
- Where wine gets its different flavors from
- How to taste wine
- How to describe wine

## Bourgogne (Burgundy)

Four major regions:

- Chablis: white
- Côte D’or: red and white
- Mâconnais: white
- Beaujolais: red

- Vineyards are tiny (see the map)
- To produce higher quantities, wine producers buy grapes from several vineyards and blend them together.
- Grapes that are grown in the same location will taste the same. If grapes are taken from a single vineyard to
  produce a wine, the wine will have a flavor profile that is unique to that specific location.
  - Though experiment: throw a Michelin 5-course dinner into a mixer—does it still taste well?
- Grapes from the top vineyards are therefore generally not blened to the same extent, which also means a lower
  yield. When the demand is especially high, the price skyrockets. The most expensive wine in the world therefore
  comes from Bourgogne.
- Wine producers often produce several wines where the grapes are sourced from different vineyards.

The high number of vineyards makes Bourgogne quite complex to navigate, so it's crucial to understand how to read
the label on the bottle:

- Grape: Pinot Noir
- Red wines comes primarily from _Côte de Nuits_, _Côte de Beaune_, and _Côte Chalonnaise_ (see map). Within these
  sub-regions, there are many _villages_, each with their own _appellation_.
- In Bourgogne, vineyards are classified—not the wine itself.

|  **Tier**   | **Description**                                           |                **Example Label**                 |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------: |
|  Régional   | The vineyard is located anywhere in Bourgogne.            | Bourgogne, Bourgogne Rouge, Bourgogne Pinot Noir |
|   Village   | The name of the nearby village is included on the bottle. |                Gevrey-Chambertin                 |
| Premier Cru | “1er Cru” or “Premier Cru” + the village on the bottle    |            Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru             |
|  Grand Cru  | “Grand Cru” + the village on the bottle                   |           Gevrey-Chambertin Grand Cru            |

- If all grapes come from a single vineyard, the name of the vineyard will also be included on the label; for
  example, “Gevrey-Chambertin Clos Saint-Jacques”.
- “Villes Vignes” = “Old Vines” -> concentrated flavors.

But before we throw pearls to swine, let us first learn the very basics of wine tasting.

## Basic Wine Tasting

From the time the grape starts growing until the wine is poured into your glass, many factors influence the final
taste of the wine. Generally speaking, these factors tend to be grouped into three categories each correspond to a
stage in the life of the wine:

**Primary Aromas**

These aromas come directly from the grape variety and the terroir (the environment where the grapes are grown).

**Secondary Aromas**

These aromas develop during the winemaking process, primarily through fermentation and due to the influence of oak barrels.

**Tertiary Aromas**

These aromas develop as the wine matures in the bottle or in oak barrels over an extended period of time.
