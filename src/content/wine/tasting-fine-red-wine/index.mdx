## Bourgogne—Terroir and Barrel Ageing

In this part of the wine tasting, we taste some young wines of different classification and learn how the _terroir_
and oak barrels influence the flavor profile of a wine.

- Grape: Pinot Noir
- Tannins: Low to Medium
- Acidity: Medium to High

- Vineyards are tiny (see the map). To produce higher quantities, wine producers buy grapes from several vineyards
  and blend them together. They also
  produce several different wines where the grapes are sourced from different vineyards.
- Grapes grown in the same location taste similar. If grapes are taken from a single vineyard to produce a wine, the
  wine will have a flavor profile that is unique to that specific location. Thought experiment: throw a nice meal into
  a mixer—will you be able to distinguish the differences of the various components?
- Grapes from the top vineyards are therefore generally not blened to the same extent. This means a low supply.
  When the demand is especially high, the price skyrockets. The most expensive wine in the world therefore comes
  from Bourgogne.

The high number of vineyards makes Bourgogne quite complex to navigate, so it's crucial to understand how to read
the label on the bottle:

- If all grapes come from a single vineyard, the name of the vineyard will also be included on the label; for
  example, “Gevrey-Chambertin Clos Saint-Jacques”.
- “Villes Vignes” = “Old Vines” -> concentrated flavors.
- In Bourgogne, vineyards are classified—not the wine itself.

|  **Tier**   | **Description**                                           |                **Example Label**                 |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------: |
|  Régional   | The vineyard is located anywhere in Bourgogne.            | Bourgogne, Bourgogne Rouge, Bourgogne Pinot Noir |
|   Village   | The name of the nearby village is included on the bottle. |                Gevrey-Chambertin                 |
| Premier Cru | “1er Cru” or “Premier Cru” + the village on the bottle    |            Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru             |
|  Grand Cru  | “Grand Cru” + the village on the bottle                   |           Gevrey-Chambertin Grand Cru            |

### Tasting Questions

- How does the body differ between the three wines? Is one wine fuller or more delicate than the others?
- How do the primary aromas differ between the three wines?
- Does any of the wines contain smokey aromas?
- Are the premier cru wines better than the regional wine?
- Does any of the wine contain tertiary aromas from the bottle ageing?

## Brunello di Montalcino and Barolo—Acidity and Tannins

In this part of the wine tasting, we taste red wines from two of Italy's best regions learn how to identify acidity
and tannins in a wine. These wines are somewhat older, which also allows us to explore tertiary aromas from the
bottle ageing.

- Tannins = the flavor and mouthfeel that comes from the grape skins, seeds, and stems.
- Both Brunello and Barolo are made from single grape varieties (Sangiovese and Nebbiolo,
  respectively) that are known for their high tannin content.

### Tasting Questions

- What primary aromas can you identify in the wines?
- Which wine has the highest acidity?
- Which wine has the highest tannins?
- Which wine seems to have aged the most in the bottle?
- What tertiary aromas can you identify in the wines?

## Bordeaux, Médoc—Bottle Ageing

In this part of the wine tasting, we taste some of Bordeaux's finest red wines from the left bank and learn how
bottle ageing influences the flavor profile of a wine.

- Grape: Blend of Cabernet Sauvignon & Merlot
- On the left bank in the Médoc region, some wines are classified as "Grand Cru Classé en 1855". This was a ranking
  system created for the _Exposition Universelle de Paris_ in 1855, which ranked the top-50 wines in Bordeaux based
  on their trading price at the time. Wines were split into five tiers.
- In the second tier, we find the wine Brane-Cantenac.
- In the third tier, we find the wine Chateau d'Issan.
- Both wine are from Margaux.

### Tasting Questions

1. How has the primary aromas developed through bottle ageing?
1. How has the structure tannins and acidity developed through bottle ageing?
1. How has the tertiary aromas developed through bottle ageing?
1. Despite the age difference, do you sense a difference in the quality level between the two wines? (Considering that
   they are from different classification tiers.)
