We are going to taste some of the finest red wines from France and Italy in three mini-tastings. In each tasting, we
will learn about different characteristics of red wine.

We will learn:

- About the basic flavor components of wine
- Where the flavor components come from
- How to taste and evaluate wine

## Bourgogne—Terroir and Barrels

In this part of the wine tasting, we taste some young wines of different classification and learn how the **terroir** and oak barrels influence the flavor profile of a wine.

Major subregions:

- Chablis
- Côte D’or
- Côte Chalonnaise
- Mâconnais
- (Beaujolais)

About Bourgogne red wines:

- Vineyards are tiny (see the map)
- To produce higher quantities, wine producers buy grapes from several vineyards and blend them together.
- Grapes that are grown in the same location will taste the same. If grapes are taken from a single vineyard to
  produce a wine, the wine will have a flavor profile that is unique to that specific location.
- Though experiment: throw a Michelin 5-course dinner into a mixer—does it still taste well?
- Grapes from the top vineyards are therefore generally not blened to the same extent, which also means a lower
  yield. When the demand is especially high, the price skyrockets. The most expensive wine in the world therefore
  comes from Bourgogne.
- Wine producers often produce several wines where the grapes are sourced from different vineyards.

The high number of vineyards makes Bourgogne quite complex to navigate, so it's crucial to understand how to read
the label on the bottle:

- Grape: Pinot Noir
- High quality red wines comes primarily from _Côte de Nuits_, _Côte de Beaune_, and _Côte Chalonnaise_ (see map).
  Within these
  sub-regions, there are many _villages_, each with their own _appellation_.
- In Bourgogne, vineyards are classified—not the wine itself.

|  **Tier**   | **Description**                                           |                **Example Label**                 |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------: |
|  Régional   | The vineyard is located anywhere in Bourgogne.            | Bourgogne, Bourgogne Rouge, Bourgogne Pinot Noir |
|   Village   | The name of the nearby village is included on the bottle. |                Gevrey-Chambertin                 |
| Premier Cru | “1er Cru” or “Premier Cru” + the village on the bottle    |            Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru             |
|  Grand Cru  | “Grand Cru” + the village on the bottle                   |           Gevrey-Chambertin Grand Cru            |

- If all grapes come from a single vineyard, the name of the vineyard will also be included on the label; for
  example, “Gevrey-Chambertin Clos Saint-Jacques”.
- “Villes Vignes” = “Old Vines” -> concentrated flavors.

### Questions About Our Bourgogne Wines

- What do the bottle label indicate about the wine?
  - Where in Bourgogne is it from?
  - Which tier is it?
  - Is it from a single vineyard, or is it a blend?
- Which wine do you think will be the best?
- Which primary aromas do you detect?
- Does any of the wines have secondary aromas? Which ones?
- Does any of the wines have tertiary aromas? Which ones?

But before we throw pearls to swine, let us first learn the very basics of wine tasting.

## How to Taste Wine

When tasting wine, we generally follow these steps:

1. **Look**: Observe the color and clarity of the wine. Which nuance of red does it have?

Please refer to the [Wine Tasting Cheat Sheet](/wine/wine-tasting-cheatsheet) for a list of common wine aromas.

## Brunello di Montalcino and Barolo—Acidity and Tannins

In this part of the wine tasting, we taste two of Italy's finest red wines and learn how to identify acidity and
tannins in a wine. These wines are somewhat older, which also allows us to explore tertiary aromas.

- Tannins = the flavor and mouthfeel that comes from the grape skins, seeds, and stems.

## Bordeaux—Bottle Ageing

In this part of the wine tasting, we taste some of Bordeaux's finest red wines and learn how bottle aging
influences the flavor profile of a wine.
